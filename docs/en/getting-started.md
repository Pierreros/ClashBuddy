# Getting Started with ClashBuddy

Getting started using ClashBuddy is very straight forward.

## Device Setup

You need an android device that allows you to run the game. The easiest way to get a device is an emulator. Follow one of our guides to get started.

* [MEmu](./devices/memu.md)
* [Bluestacks 3](https://community.botandrobot.com/discussion/23/using-bluestacks-look-here)
* [Lenovo Moto G5/G5 Plus](./devices/lenovo-moto-g5-plus.md)

Once your device is ready you have multiple options to install the target game. Either you get the [APK from a mirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-royale-supercell/) or you install the game from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashroyale). Once the game is installed you're ready to run the bot.

## Bot Setup

Go to the [Bot and Robot Shop](https://botandrobot.shop/) and download the latest version of the bot. It will come in a zip file. To use the bot extract the files to a folder for example ```C:\BOTS\ClashBuddy```. Inside this folder you will find ClashBuddy.exe file. This is the main assembly of the bot. Start the executable and you will see a console window open.

The Launcher will open a browser window with that contains the ui of the bot.
First thing you will have to do is authenticating with your key. If you don't have a key go to the [Bot and Robot Shop](https://botandrobot.shop/) and order one there.

The next screen is the Device Setup screen.

When you click on the Add button you will be able to enter host and port of a not shown device. Select your device and click continue.
When only one device is connected this step is skipped and the bot will connect to the device and start the game when required.

When you hit play right away, Apollo will be setup with it's default settings and the bot will start its work. You can customize the Action Selector and even create your own. Action Selectors define the behavior of the bot. You can find the action selector selection in the settings area.

Apollo is the out of the box default action selector. It currently will play at around 1800 Trophies. With a deck like:

* P.E.K.K.A
* Freeze
* Wizard
* Baby Dragon
* Giant
* Musketeer
* Witch
* Skeleton Army
